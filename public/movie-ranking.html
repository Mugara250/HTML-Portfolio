<h2>The following are my all-time favorite movies:</h2>

<h3>Drunken Master</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the earliest movies by Jackie Chan, a well-decorated Chinese actor.
    It expresses his acting humor which is one of his exquisite qualities as an actor.
</p>
<h3>Hard Target</h3>
<p>
    This is probably one of the most watched movies by the American-Belgian born, Jean Claude Van Damme.
    Van Damme expresses his impeccable martial art skills. The movie also features Arnold Vosloo, a South African-American actor
    who is known for playing the role of the bad guy in most of the movies he has played.
